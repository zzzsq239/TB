# TB-DLossNet
Camellia oleifera is an economically vital woody oil crop. Its productivity and oil quality are severely compromised by various diseases. Implementing pixel-level lesion segmentation within complex field environments is crucial for advancing precision plant protection. Despite recent progress, existing segmentation methods struggle with three primary challenges: semantic ambiguity arising from evolving pathological stages, blurred boundaries due to overlapping lesions, and the high omission rate of micro-lesions. To address these issues, this paper presents TB-DLossNet (Text-Conditioned Boundary-Aware Network with Dynamic Loss Reweighting), a novel segmentation framework based on semantic-visual multi-modal fusion.Leveraging VMamba as the visual backbone, the proposed model innovatively integrates BERT-encoded structured text as an auxiliary modality to resolve visual ambiguities through cross-modal semantic guidance. Furthermore, a boundary enhancement branch is incorporated alongside a multi-scale deep supervision strategy to mitigate boundary displacement and ensure the topological continuity of lesion structures. To tackle the detection of small-scale targets, we designed a dynamic weight loss function conditioned on lesion area, significantly bolstering the model’s sensitivity to minute pathological features. Additionally, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality data, we curated a comprehensive multi-modal dataset encompassing seven typical diseases of Camellia oleifera. Experimental results demonstrate that TB-DLossNet achieves a Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 87.02%, outperforming the state-of-the-art unimodal VMamba and multimodal Lvit by 4.9% and 2.59%, respectively. Qualitative evaluations confirm that our model exhibits lower false-negative rates and superior boundary-fitting precision in heterogeneous field scenarios. Finally, generalization tests on an apple disease dataset further validate the robustness and transferability of the proposed framework.
